# Pictures-scraper
An app that collects an images and links from various sources(twitter, pixiv, mihoyo bbs, lofter) merging them into a single stream. 

Built in fastapi and vue
## Why?
- it's tedious to check all the sources one-by-one just to see mainly the same pictures
- twitter limit it's feed output so you can scroll up to 12-14 hours back at most
- it's hard to keep track of the pictures that you have already seen
